# Python_Everything_Is_Object

This project is a little bit different than the usual projects. most of the questions are about Python’s specificity like “What would be the result of…”. Then new concepts such as aliasing, mutation and cloning lists.

## General Requirements
All answers for the questions should be in a file with  `.txt extension` 
- One line only
- No shebang
- All files should end with a new line
