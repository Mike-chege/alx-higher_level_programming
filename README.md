# Higher_level_programming

A high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use:
- natural language elements
- Be easier to use
- or may automate(or even hide entirely)
significant areas of computing systems(e.g memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a lower-level language, the amount of abstraction provided defines how "high-level" a programming language is.
